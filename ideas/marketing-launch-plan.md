## Plan A: Reddit Launch Campaign

**Title:** "Community-First Reddit Launch"
**Description:** Build credibility and organic reach across targeted subreddits by contributing genuine value first, then introducing Tempy.Email as a solution to real problems users discuss daily — spam, privacy, and throwaway signups.

### Strategy

Reddit punishes pure self-promotion. The golden rule: _"Websites don't have Reddit accounts, but a Redditor can have a website."_ Build karma and reputation first, promote second.

### Phase 1: Pre-Launch (2-3 weeks before)

- Create or establish a Reddit account with genuine participation
- Contribute helpful answers in privacy and tech subreddits (aim for 100-500+ karma)
- Follow the **9:1 rule** — nine value-adding contributions per one promotional post
- Identify and bookmark threads where people ask about disposable email, spam prevention, or privacy tools

### Phase 2: Soft Launch

- Post as "I built this" or "looking for feedback" rather than "check out my product"
- Ask what features people want, what pain points they have with existing tools
- Share the extension in feedback-friendly subreddits first

### Phase 3: Broader Push

- Cross-post to larger subreddits once you have social proof (reviews, user count)
- Share use-case stories: "How I stopped getting spam from every signup form"
- Create a short demo GIF showing the overlay auto-detecting email fields

### Recommended Subreddits

#### Tier 1 — Launch Here First (promotion-friendly)

### Reddit Post Templates

**Feedback Post:**
> "I built a browser extension for disposable emails — looking for feedback"
> Tired of giving away my real email to every site that demands one. Built a Chrome/Firefox extension that generates a temporary email in one click, auto-fills forms, and even shows incoming messages + OTP codes right in the popup. Would love honest feedback on what to improve.

**Problem-Solution Post:**
> "How I stopped getting spam from 'free trial' signups"
> Every time I sign up for a free trial, newsletter, or random site, my inbox gets flooded. I built Tempy.Email to solve this — it generates a disposable address, auto-detects email fields, and lets you read replies directly in the extension. No account needed.

## Plan B: Chrome Web Store Growth Strategy

**Title:** "Chrome Web Store SEO & Organic Growth Engine"
**Description:** Maximize organic discovery inside the Chrome Web Store through listing optimization, strategic keyword targeting, review solicitation, and content marketing that builds backlinks to the store listing.

### Strategy

The Chrome Web Store is the primary discovery channel. Your store listing page also ranks in Google Search. Optimizing it is the highest-ROI activity for long-term growth.

### 1. Chrome Web Store Listing Optimization

**Title:** Use primary keywords naturally
- Current: "Tempy Email" (too short)
- Better: "Tempy Email — Disposable Temporary Email for Signups & Privacy"
- Keywords to target: disposable email, temporary email, temp mail, fake email, burner email, spam protection

**Description:**
- First 132 characters are critical (shown in search results)
- Lead with the value proposition, not the feature list
- Include keywords naturally: "Generate a disposable temporary email address in one click. Auto-fills signup forms. Read incoming messages and OTP codes right in the popup. No account needed. Free."

**Screenshots & Video:**
- Create 5 annotated screenshots showing: overlay on email field, one-click generation, message viewer with OTP, settings, and context menu
- Add a 30-second demo video (significantly increases install conversion)

**Category:** Productivity (primary), or possibly "Privacy & Security" if available

**Localization:**
- Translate listing into 10+ languages (each language version gets its own store page, expanding discoverability)
- Priority languages: Spanish, Portuguese, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Chinese, Turkish, Italian

### 2. Get the "Featured" Badge

Google awards Featured badges to extensions that meet quality criteria:
- Follow Chrome Web Store best practices
- Have a well-crafted store listing
- Demonstrate technical quality (no errors, fast performance)
- Maintain good user ratings

This badge significantly boosts visibility in store search results.

### 3. Review & Rating Strategy

- Add an in-extension prompt after 3-5 successful email generations: "Enjoying Tempy Email? A quick rating helps us a lot"
- Link directly to the Chrome Web Store review page
- Respond to every review (positive and negative)
- Target: 4.5+ star average within first 100 reviews

### 4. Content Marketing & Backlinks

Write blog posts / articles that link back to the Chrome Web Store listing:
- "5 Ways to Protect Your Email from Spam in 2026"
- "Why You Should Never Use Your Real Email for Free Trials"
- "How Disposable Email Extensions Work (And Why You Need One)"
- "The Developer's Guide to Testing Email Flows Without Burning Real Addresses"

Target platforms for guest posts:
- Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium (developer audience)
- Privacy-focused blogs willing to review tools
- Tech tutorial sites (MakeUseOf, How-To Geek, Lifehacker — aim for listicle inclusion)

### 5. Track & Iterate

- Monitor Chrome Web Store analytics: impressions, installs, uninstall rate
- A/B test descriptions and screenshots if possible
- Improve retention (Google favors extensions with low uninstall rates and high daily active use)

---

## Plan C: Firefox & Privacy Community Strategy

**Title:** "Privacy-Native Firefox & AMO Growth Campaign"
**Description:** Position Tempy.Email as a privacy-first tool within the Firefox ecosystem, leveraging Firefox users' strong privacy values and Mozilla's add-on community.

### Strategy

Firefox users self-select for privacy. They chose Firefox *because* of its privacy stance. This makes them the ideal audience for a disposable email tool. The messaging should lean heavily into privacy, not just convenience.

### 1. Firefox Add-on Store (AMO) Optimization

- Mirror the Chrome Web Store optimization but tailor messaging to Firefox values
- Emphasize: "No tracking. No accounts. No data collection. Just disposable emails."
- Highlight that the extension works with Firefox's Enhanced Tracking Protection
- Use Firefox-specific screenshots (showing the extension in Firefox UI)

### 2. Privacy Community Outreach

**Forums & Communities:**
- **Privacy Guides community** (privacyguides.net forum) — active discussion of recommended tools
- **Techlore community** — privacy-focused YouTube channel and forum
- **The New Oil** — privacy blog that reviews tools
- **PTIO (PrivacyTools.io)** — maintained list of recommended privacy tools; getting listed here drives sustained traffic

**Goal:** Get Tempy.Email listed as a recommended disposable email tool on privacy resource sites.

### 3. Messaging Angles for Firefox/Privacy Audience

| Angle | Message |
|-------|---------|
| Anti-tracking | "85% of emails contain hidden tracking pixels. Don't give them your real address." |
| Data minimization | "The best way to protect your data is to never share it. Generate a disposable address for every signup." |
| No-account simplicity | "No signup. No login. No data stored on our servers after expiry. True disposable email." |
| Open source appeal | Consider open-sourcing the extension code to build trust with privacy advocates |

### 4. Privacy Newsletter Sponsorships

- **TLDR Newsletter** (privacy/security edition) — large tech audience
- **The Hacker News newsletter** — developer/security focused
- **Privacy-focused YouTubers** — sponsor a 30-60 second segment

### 5. Cross-Browser Promotion

- On the Chrome listing, mention Firefox support (and vice versa)
- "Available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Brave" — Manifest V3 compatibility makes multi-browser a selling point

---

## Plan D: Additional Channels & Paid Advertising

**Title:** "Beyond Reddit — Multi-Channel Growth Playbook"
**Description:** Expand reach beyond Reddit and browser stores through Product Hunt launches, developer communities, social media, partnerships, and targeted advertising.

### Free / Organic Channels

#### 1. Product Hunt Launch

- **Priority: HIGH** — Product Hunt is the single best launch platform for developer/privacy tools
- Schedule launch for a Tuesday or Wednesday (highest traffic days)
- Prepare: tagline, description, 4-5 screenshots, demo GIF, maker comment
- Rally early supporters to upvote in the first 4 hours (critical window)
- Tagline idea: "Stop giving your real email to every website. One-click disposable emails."

#### 2. Hacker News (Show HN)

- Post as "Show HN: Tempy.Email — Browser extension for disposable emails with OTP extraction"
- HN audience values: technical elegance, privacy, open source, no BS
- Emphasize: no build tools, no frameworks, vanilla JS, MV3 compliant
- Be active in comments — HN rewards thoughtful engagement

#### 3. Indie Hackers

- Post a build-in-public story: how you built it, what decisions you made, user growth
- Indie Hackers community loves transparent sharing of metrics and lessons learned
- Cross-promote in the Indie Hackers podcast if possible

#### 4. Dev.to / Hashnode / Medium

- Write technical articles: "Building a Chrome Extension with Zero Dependencies in 2026"
- Include the extension as a natural reference, not hard promotion
- Tag appropriately: #webdev #privacy #chrome #javascript

#### 5. GitHub & Open Source

- If open-sourced: GitHub trending can drive significant traffic
- Add a clear README with install links, screenshots, and badges
- Create GitHub Discussions for feature requests and community engagement

#### 6. Twitter/X & Mastodon

- Share short demo videos/GIFs showing the extension in action
- Engage with #privacy, #infosec, #webdev, #buildinpublic hashtags
- Mastodon is particularly active among privacy-conscious users

#### 7. YouTube

- Create a 2-minute demo video for the extension
- Reach out to tech/privacy YouTubers for reviews:
  - Techlore, The Hacker Journal, All Things Secured, Rob Braxman Tech
  - Smaller channels (5K-50K subscribers) are more likely to respond and often have highly engaged audiences

#### 8. TikTok / Reels / Shorts

- Short-form video is underused for browser extensions
- "This free extension stops email spam" — 15-second hook + demo
- Privacy tips content that naturally features the extension

#### 9. Extension Directory Listings

Submit to extension directories and "best of" lists:
- AlternativeTo.net (list as alternative to Guerrilla Mail, Temp Mail, etc.)
- SaaSHub
- ToolPilot.ai
- ExtensionFast directory
- BrowserExtension.dev

#### 10. Telegram & Discord Communities

- Privacy-focused Telegram groups (active advertising channel for privacy tools)
- Developer Discord servers
- Cryptocurrency communities (temp email is popular for exchange signups)

### Paid Advertising (When Ready to Scale)

#### 1. Google Ads (Search)

- Target keywords: "disposable email extension", "temp mail chrome", "temporary email generator"
- Low competition compared to mainstream SaaS keywords
- Link directly to Chrome Web Store listing

#### 2. Reddit Ads

- Target specific subreddits: r/privacy, r/chrome, r/webdev
- Reddit ads can be effective when they look native (use conversational copy)
- Start with $5-10/day to test conversion

#### 3. Carbon Ads / BuySellAds

- Developer-focused ad networks that place on sites like Stack Overflow, dev blogs
- High-quality traffic from technical users

#### 4. Sponsoring Privacy Newsletters

- Cost-effective way to reach a targeted audience
- Many privacy newsletters accept small sponsors ($50-200 per issue)

#### 5. Cross-Promotion Partnerships

- Partner with VPN providers (NordVPN, ProtonVPN, Mullvad) for mutual promotion
- Partner with password managers (Bitwarden, Proton Pass) — complementary tools
- Partner with anti-detect browser tools (DICloak, GoLogin) — temp email is essential for their users

## Competitive Positioning

### Main Competitors
- **Temp Mail** (temp-mail.io) — well-established, Chrome extension with 4.8 stars
- **Guerrilla Mail** — long-standing service, basic extension
- **AdGuard Temp Mail** — backed by AdGuard brand
- **10 Minute Mail** — popular but no browser extension

### Tempy.Email Differentiators
- **Auto-detect email fields** with overlay icons (competitors require manual copy-paste)
- **OTP extraction** from incoming messages (unique feature)
- **Framework-compatible form filling** (React/Vue support via native property descriptors)
- **Shadow DOM isolation** (overlay doesn't break page CSS)
- **No account required** — zero friction
- **Cross-browser** — Chrome + Firefox from day one
- **Clean, modern UI** with live countdown timer

Use these differentiators in every marketing message. The auto-detect + OTP extraction combo is the strongest unique selling point.
